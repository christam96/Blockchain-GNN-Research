# Understanding Ethereum via Graph Analysis (2020)

Interested in:
- Data collection methods for money flow graph (MFG), smart contract creation graph (CCG) and smart contract invocation graph (CIG)
  - Non-trivial to collect all transaction data because _internal transactions not stored in blockchain_

Tangent research ideas:
- Smart contract invocation graph: Who uses which smart contracts?
  - Similarities between users who use similar smart contracts?
- Characteristics of strongly connected components (SCCs)
  - Opportunity for node labelling?

*Can we use GNNs/graph analysis to understand the incentives created by Web3?*
- Hypothesis testing?
