Tracking research ideas and opportunities.

- Dataset creation: Create datasets for specific Web3 applications?
  - Marketplaces
  - NFTs
  - Web3 IDs
  - Cross-chain?

- Literature review: Other problems beyond phishing detection?
  - Some nice ideas discussed in 'Understanding Ethereum via Graph Analysis' by T. Chen et al.

- Capture network effects in response to stimuli
  - Temporal analysis of subgraph effects
  - E.x. NFT launch at timestep T, network effects at timestep T+1,T+2,..T+N
  - Embedded representation at each timestep
  - Do similar representations display similar network patterns?

- 'Tag' contract, deploy in network and observe network effects
-
